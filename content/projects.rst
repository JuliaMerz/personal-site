Projects
=========

I'll add more projects and especially more demos here soon. For now please take a 
look at my LinkedIn or my resume, together they contain descriptions of a sizable
chunk of my past work, at least the completed and/or working stuff.

Gendrratio
-----------
Facebook provides a lot of API data. What it doesn't do is provide all of that data
about random people who aren't your friends or even acquiantances. Gendrratio was born
out of a desire to do some analytics about facebook events and display them in cool ways,
and wasn't originally about gender. Unfortunately, since facebook events almost always
contain people you don't know, every other set of data was locked away by privacy settings,
at least for the vast majority of people. With gender as the only data set to work with,
I decided to just display that in the awesomest way possible. Gendrratio is the result.

ECC Problem Generator
---------------------------
This was made after a computer science professor at UC Berkeley wanted someone to take
an offline script that printed some ECC problems and put it online. I converted the
script to use a web form instead of stdin for input and display errors in a more
graceful manner. Then I stuck it into a Flask server and put it up here.
