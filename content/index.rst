I'm an Electrical Engineering Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. 
I mostly do full stack web development, and I have experience with everything from
front end javascript to apache configuration and project deployment. At the moment, my 
favorite language is python, and my favorite framework is Flask. 

When I'm not coding, I run officer meetings and handle overall business
for Hackers\@Berkeley, a director at Cal Hacks, and a founder-in-absentia
at `eXodus eSports <http://www.exodusesports.com>`_ . Besides that I enjoy surfing, windsurfing,
and experimenting with digital art.
