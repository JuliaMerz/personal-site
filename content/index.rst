I'm an Electrical Engineering Computer Science student at UC Berkeley. 
I do a lot of work on backend stuff in python. When I'm not coding I serve as
executive officer for Hackers\@Berkeley, a director at Cal Hacks, and a founder-in-absentia
at `eXodus eSports <http://www.exodusesports.com>`_ 
Maybe someday I'll be important enough to write an autobiography, but for now
you'll have to be satisfied with what's written here, and if you want to know 
more, you can ask me!
