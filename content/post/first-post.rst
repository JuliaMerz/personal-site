So I finally got around to making a personal site. It only took me like a year!

Yeah, there's not too much to see yet. I decided I was going to use blohg for the backend
after realizing that someone had already written a Flask CMS. Although they hadn't shared
it, that was enough to make me want to not do it again, so I googled for Flask-based bloggin
platforms. I wanted something based on Flask because I knew then I could stretch the
platform to make it do what I wanted it to do on the front end and, if necessary, the 
backend as well. Blohg fit the bill. It takes in rst and throws it up as html. The
templating framework was flexible enough, so I took it and made it look and behave
the way I wanted it to. 

The most interesting thing about this is that the entire thing is based on git, which
I guess it kind of neat, although I haven't really seen the practical effects too much,
besides that I have to git add before things will show up on my test server. I guess
for me I'm used to git pulling for changes anyway, so it doesn't feel too different,
but going from something like wordpress the change might be more severe.
