Esports
==================

Beyond all of my time in the engineering community, my other major pastime has been
in the world of competitive gaming, where I spent time as a professional video game
commentator.

What Is Esports?
-------------------
Since this is a general site, a quick explanation is in order. Esports, also called
competitive gaming, is exactly what it sounds like. Video games, played competitively,
for fame, glory, and the occasional cash prize of millions of dollars. Here's `a quick
explanation <http://recode.net/2014/06/22/what-are-esports-a-pro-video-gaming-guide-for-the-rest-of-us/>`_ from some people who are much better at writing than I am.

My Background
--------------
I never really competed in esports, but I spent time in both `FireFall <http://www.firefall.com/>`_ and `Planetary Annihilation <http://www.uberent.com/pa/>`_ 
as a commentator, site administrator, and occasional journalist. I've done everything from
run tournaments, host talk shows, interview personalities, and commentate games. The latter
two I did as an employee of the `National ESL <http://www.nationalesl.com/us>`_ during the summer of 2013. When I have a bit more time I'll dig up some links to some past broadcasts.
